# Exploratory Modeling

See if you can run cross validation on the 
initial models, or even better a simple 
bayesian grid with controlled iterations.

### Initial Model Selection

10 models at least

### Final Model Selection

Hopefully gradient boost and random forest, along
with one other.

### Model Metrics

Easy to understand metrics. r squared seems
to be the going metric, but you can also evaluate
across others. r squared is the important one 
though.
