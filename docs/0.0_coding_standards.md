# Coding Standards

Try to start with autogenerated project
but going to have to modify folder 
structure to fit this project.
Try to check in code at end of 25 minute
block. Maybe can set an auto routine for this?
Stay on step branches. Set some sort of pr
block so the code cannot be committed to 
master before approval

### Library Code Formatting

- Try to use prettier. 
- Check for coding documentation. 
- Use separate branches for each step in 
the process.
- Test writing.

### Notebook Formatting

- May benefit from template. 
- Increment notebooks from *.1 onwards
- \*.*_camel_case for naming
- Can run on website?

### Data Formatting

- SCREAMING_CAMEL_CASE.csv for intermittent data. 
- Try to sort data into folders with only one 
file named after the steps in the process.

### Data Documentation

- Whatever you can autogenerate.
- May benefit from making it an
online experience.

### Figure Formatting

- Static figures outputted to the highest 
resolution possible. 
- Try to work in dynamic figures for possible
 website
 
 ### Website deployment
 Can do website in django. May be able to
 deploy on firebase which would be nice for
 auth and database. May want to think about
 switching out auth0 for auth provider. Look
 into doing direct deployment of notebooks,
 data evaluation, and figures to website on
 certain commits
